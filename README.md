### With our country being in one of the most devistating crisis ever,  the *Covid-19* pandemic has impacted most Americans *physical*, *social* and *emotional* well-being, while plummeting the nation’s economy.  As the country economic is restructured, federal, state, and local governments will be looking for new forms of revenue to replenish depleting budgets and provide jobs to millions of Americans who are now unemployed. Many states across the country have been turning to cannabis businesses as a source of much needed tax revenue reform and employment for many.  Nearly every state with legal cannabis has found marijuana businesses to be pivotal during the *Covid-19* pandemic.
## The *Agrisoft* platform is used in cannabis dispensaries including cultivation and regulatory operations in numerous states and Canada.  It provides these facilities with back-office, inventory, biometric security designed specifically for governments and regulatory agencies, state regulation reporting systems and payment system adaptability.  With the expansion of legalized cannabis there's been more stringent regulations for inventory requirements including mandates for tracking cannabis and cannabis products from seed-to-sale.
