### With our country being in one of the most devastating crises ever, the *Covid-19* pandemic has impacted most Americans *physical*, *social* and *emotional* well-being, while plummeting the nation’s economy.  As the country economic is restructured, federal, state, and local governments will be looking for new forms of revenue to replenish depleting budgets and provide jobs to millions of Americans who are now unemployed. Many states across the country have been turning to cannabis businesses as a source of much needed tax revenue reform and employment for many.  Nearly every state with legal cannabis has found marijuana businesses to be pivotal during the *Covid-19* pandemic.
## The *Agrisoft* platform is used in cannabis dispensaries including cultivation and regulatory operations in numerous states and Canada.  It provides these facilities with back-office, inventory, biometric security designed specifically for governments and regulatory agencies, state regulation reporting systems and payment system adaptability.  With the expansion of legalized cannabis there has been more stringent regulations for inventory requirements including mandates for tracking cannabis and cannabis products from seed-to-sale.

#### There has been several major trends and innovations of these domain over the last 5-10 years.
#### The brilliance of being able to provide every service needed in the industry from Seed to Sale and to provide funding compliance regulations and product security every step of the way.  Accelerating focus on Digital Transformation, building a Cognitive side to the business, re-thinking the concept of Money and removing the use cash from the industry. Making all transactions transparent is key to the Industry and regulatory Compliance Rules.
#### Some Of the major companies in theses Domains are **Ample Organics, Simplifya, BioTrackTHC, Flowhub.

#### Many lenders are concerned about lending money to upstart businesses this has been a huge impact. Traditional lenders and banks will lend money only to established companies that are in a solid financial position. Even if your new business could get a loan, it may not be enough or the desired amount. As a result, you may be forced to scale down the operation or reconsider opening the business. With Venture Capitalist and Angel Investors the worries of traditional financing have been reduced. 

 
#### Acquisition Metrics, Activation Metrics, and	Retention Metrics, are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success. This has not waivered the proformance of Kind Financial or Agrisoft, based on these metrics. Revenues Metrics report $4 Million,	Marketing Metrics, and Technical Metrics are on target per US News.

#### Kind Financial has performed well relative to competitors in the same domain.
#### Full-Year Financial Performance Report
#### Regardless of the continious impact of COVID-19, the full year’s cloud backlog was up *7%* year over year to **€7.15 billion** (up *14%* at constant currencies). Cloud revenue registered *17%* year over year growth to **€8.08 billion** (IFRS), up *15%* to **€8.09 billion** (non-IFRS) and up *18%* to **€8.24 billion** (non-IFRS at constant currencies), exceeding the revised full-year outlook **(€8.0 to €8.2 billion non-IFRS at constant currencies).** Cloud and software revenue was up *1%* year over year to **€23.23 billion** (IFRS and non-IFRS) and up *3%* to **€23.72 billion** (non-IFRS at constant currencies), exceeding the revised full-year outlook **(€23.1 – 23.6 billion).** Total revenue was down 1% year over year to **€27.34 billion** (IFRS and non-IFRS) and up *1%* to **€27.90 billion** (non-IFRS at constant currencies), also exceeding the revised full-year outlook **(€27.2 – 27.8 billion).

#### If I were to advise the company, I would suggest Stock IPO, s. The Cannabis Stock IPO, SPACs Tracker, managed by New Cannabis Ventures, tracks upcoming initial public offerings of cannabis companies within the U.S., Canada and other countries. The tracker provides data on upcoming SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) and RTOs (Reverse Takeovers). This tracker will update based on new filings. Companies must file with the SEC, SEDAR or their regulatory authority to be considered for inclusion. I would off this service simply because having access to more capital and being able to use stock as currency to make purchases or investments and grow the business are the main advantages of Legalization.
#### This service would utilize some of the same practices as the current the current products to include *Payments, Lending Regulation Technology (RegTech) Enterprise Solutions.* These technologies are appropriate solutions to the marijuana industry several companies looking to raise capital to expand and stay ahead of the competition by going public.
